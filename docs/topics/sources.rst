Document sources define from where documents will be uploaded or gathered.
To add a document source go to the ``Setup`` section, then to the ``Sources`` section.
To obtain the fastest working setup, create a new source of type ``Web form``.
``Web forms`` are just HTML forms with a ``Browse`` button that will open the file upload
dialog when clicked. Name it something simple like ``Local documents`` and select whether or not
compressed files uploaded from this source will be automatically decompressed and
their content treated as individual documents.
