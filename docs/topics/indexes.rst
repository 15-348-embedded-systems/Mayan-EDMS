Indexes
=======

Administrators first define the template of the index and an instance
of the index is then auto-populated with links to the documents depending
on the rules of each branch of the index evaluated againts the metadata
of the documents.  The index cannot be edited manually, only changing
the rules or the metadata of the documents would cause the index to be
regenerated.  For manual organization of documents there are the folders,
their structure is however flat, and they have to be manually updated and
curated.
