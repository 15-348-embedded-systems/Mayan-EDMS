Home screen
-----------
Sometimes users just want to go directly to work and not just be greeted with
a home screen. For these kind of situations **Mayan EDMS** has the
:setting:`MAIN_DISABLE_HOME_VIEW` configuration option, which will cause
users to land on their ``recent document list`` as soon as they log in.
