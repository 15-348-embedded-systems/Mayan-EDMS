-----------
Home screen
-----------
Sometimes users just want to go directly to work and not just be greeted with
a home screen. For these kind of situations **Mayan EDMS** has the
:setting:`MAIN_DISABLE_HOME_VIEW` configuration option, which will cause
users to land on their ``recent document list`` as soon as they log in.

-----
Icons
-----
Some themes such as ``default`` might be more visually appealing to some
people without the menu icons, for this **Mayan EDMS** provides the
:setting:`MAIN_DISABLE_ICONS` configuration option.
