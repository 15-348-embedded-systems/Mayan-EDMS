* Following error when using MySQL and doing OCR on languages other than english:
    Incorrect string value: '\xE2\x80\x95rs6...' for column 'content' at row 1
    
    - Solution:
    Use utf-8 collation on MySQL server, or at least in table 'documents_documentpage', 'content' field

* File system links not showing on client computers when serving content with Samba:
    - Solution:
    Disable unix extensions in the [global] section and enable wide links for the file serving share

    - Example:
    [global]
        unix extensions = no

    [digitalizacion]
        path = /var/local/mayan
        guest ok = yes
        read only = yes
        wide links = yes
        follow symlinks = yes

* How to store documents outside Mayan's path:
    1)Sub class Django's FileSystemStorage class:
        -Create a file called customstorage.py
        
        from django.core.files.storage import FileSystemStorage

        class CustomStorage(FileSystemStorage):
            def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
                super(CustomStorage, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)
                self.location='/new/path/to/documents/'
                self.base_url='document_storage'

    2)In settings.py add:
        from customstorage import CustomStorage
        DOCUMENTS_STORAGE_BACKEND = CustomStorage


* How to enable the GridFS storage backend
    - Solution:
    Add the following lines to settings.py:
        from storage.backends.gridfsstorage import GridFSStorage
        DOCUMENTS_STORAGE_BACKEND = GridFSStorage
        
    - Filesystem metadata indexing will not work with this storage backend as
        file are inside a MongoDB database and can't be linked (at least for now)

* Site search is slow
    - Add indexes to the following fields:
        documents_document - description, recomended size: 160
        documents_documentmetadata - value, recomended size: 80
        documents_documentpage - content, recomended size: 3000
