Mayan EDMS 0.12 release notes
========================

*February 2012*

Welcome to Mayan EDMS 0.12!

This release commemorates **Mayan EDMS** first aniversary!

Overview
========

**Mayan EDMS** focus has mostly been on improving the code quality standard
even further.  The permission system has been completely overhauled to make
it entire class based.  The other big change is the addition of object
level permissions, with this new system being applied to documents,
folder, tags and smart links.

Upgrading
=========

::

    $ ./manage.py syncdb
    $ ./manage.py migrate permissions 0001 --fake
    $ ./manage.py migrate permissions


When the following message appears

``The following content types are stale and need to be deleted:

    permissions | permission

Any objects related to these content types by a foreign key will also
be deleted. Are you sure you want to delete these content types?
If you're unsure, answer 'no'.

    Type 'yes' to continue, or 'no' to cancel:``
    
    Types ``yes`` and press **Enter**

::

	$ ./manage.py migrate documents
    $ ./manage.py migrate document_signatures


Backward incompatible changes
=============================
The permission system has been completely reworked so sadly this is a
place where even data migration can't help and the permissions assigned
to roles will be lost during the upgrade to version 0.12.  Users, groups
and roles will be preserved only permissions need to be assigned again,
so write down your role permission setup before upgrading.
