=============================
Mayan EDMS v2.5 release notes
=============================

Released: July XX, 2017

What's new
==========


Other Changes
-------------
- Add view to download a document's OCR text. GitLab issue #215.
- Add missing OCR migration.
- Improve error output of the performupgrade command to debug upgrade errors
  that could stop an upgrade (missing document files, etc).
- Enable the django-mathfilters app added in version 2.4.
- Do a complete pull and synchronization of the translations to fix missing
  translations for Polish. Thanks to Wojtek Warczakowski for the report.
- Allow null for the SANE source resolution field. Even though the field was
  marked as allowing blank values it was failing because it is a number field
  and number fields need to allow explicit null values when left blank.
- Rename the mayan_task_manager app to task_manager.
- Make the task manager translatable.
- Add Turkish to the list of processes languages.
- Add user configurable mailer support. GitLab issue #286.
