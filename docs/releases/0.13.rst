Upgrading from a previous version
=================================

Start off by adding the new requirements::

  $ pip install -r requirements/production.txt

Then create the new database structures with::

    $ ./manage.py syncdb

Afterwards migrate existing database schema with::

    $ ./manage.py migrate permissions 0001 --fake
    $ ./manage.py migrate permissions


When the following message appears

::

    The following content types are stale and need to be deleted:

        permissions | permission

    Any objects related to these content types by a foreign key will also
    be deleted. Are you sure you want to delete these content types?
    If you're unsure, answer 'no'.

        Type 'yes' to continue, or 'no' to cancel:
    
Type ``yes`` and press **Enter**

And continue migrating database schema with::

    $ ./manage.py migrate documents
    $ ./manage.py migrate document_signatures
    $ ./manage.py migrate folders 0001 --fake
    $ ./manage.py migrate folders
    $ ./manage.py migrate document_indexing 0001 --fake
    $ ./manage.py migrate document_indexing
    $ ./manage.py migrate sources 0001 --fake
    $ ./manage.py migrate sources

Again when a similar messages appears
::

    The following content types are stale and need to be deleted:

        document_indexing | indexinstance

    Any objects related to these content types by a foreign key will also
    be deleted. Are you sure you want to delete these content types?
    If you're unsure, answer 'no'.

        Type 'yes' to continue, or 'no' to cancel:

Type ``yes`` and press **Enter**

The upgrade procedure is now complete.
