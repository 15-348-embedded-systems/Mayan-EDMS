Version 4.0.2
=============

Released: May 25, 2021

Changes
-------

API
^^^

Some API endpoints that used parent-child resources were not working
correctly on some use cases when using token authentication, returning error
404 for valid requests. The API views now ensure that authentication has
completed before doing initial filtering on the parent resource.

The Django REST framework version was updated from version 3.11.0 to 3.11.2.


Cabinets
^^^^^^^^

A solution for the longstanding issue of cabinet sorting was found. Cabinets
are a nested model and cannot be sorted properly with Django's queryset
sorting methods. Native tree sorting was implemented. This requires a rebuild
of the existing cabinet tree which is accomplished by an included migration.

The django-mptt library was updated from version 0.11.0 to 0.12.0.


Dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^

PIP was updated from version 21.0.1 to 21.1.1.


Documentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Several typos in the documentation were fixed. More context was added to some
upgrade steps.


Messaging
^^^^^^^^^

Support for marking messages as unread was added.

Opening a message will now mark it as read automatically.


User interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The action dropdown template partial was moved to the navigation app.

Some unused and deprecated markup was removed.

The appearance of disabled action links was fixed.


Other
^^^^^

- Minor source string fixes.


Removals
--------

- None

Upgrade process
---------------

Upgrading from Mayan EDMS 3.5.x
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Stop supervisord::

    sudo systemctl stop supervisor


#. Make a backup of your supervisord file:

   .. code-block:: bash

       sudo cp |MAYAN_SUPERVISOR_CONF| |MAYAN_SUPERVISOR_CONF|.bck


#. Make a backup of your database:

   Use the respective backup command for the database:

     - PostgreSQL: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/backup-dump.html
     - MySQL: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/mysqldump.html


#. Upgrade to the latest pip version:

   .. code-block:: bash

       sudo -u |DEFAULT_OS_USERNAME| |MAYAN_PIP_BIN| install -U pip


#. Remove deprecated requirements:

   .. code-block:: bash

    sudo -u |DEFAULT_OS_USERNAME| curl |SOURCE_CODE_REPOSITORY|raw/master/removals.txt -o /tmp/removals.txt \
    && sudo -u |DEFAULT_OS_USERNAME| |MAYAN_PIP_BIN| uninstall -y -r /tmp/removals.txt


#. Update the Mayan EDMS Python package:

   .. code-block:: bash

    sudo -u |DEFAULT_OS_USERNAME| |MAYAN_PIP_BIN| install mayan-edms==|MAYAN_VERSION|

   the requirements will also be updated automatically.


#. Create the ``|DEFAULT_USER_SETTINGS_FOLDER|`` folder inside the ``media``
   folder and convert it into a Python module. This folder is used for
   custom setting modules. Adjust the path of the ``media`` folder for your
   installation:

   .. code-block:: bash

    sudo -u |DEFAULT_OS_USERNAME| mkdir --parents |MAYAN_MEDIA_ROOT||DEFAULT_USER_SETTINGS_FOLDER|
    sudo -u |DEFAULT_OS_USERNAME| touch |MAYAN_MEDIA_ROOT||DEFAULT_USER_SETTINGS_FOLDER|__init__.py


#. Update the Redis configuration to serve at least 3 databases:

   Replace:

   .. code-block:: ini

      databases ...

   with:

   .. code-block:: ini

      databases 3


#. Edit the config file at ``|MAYAN_MEDIA_ROOT|/config.yml``:

   Replace:

   .. code-block:: ini

       LOCK_MANAGER_BACKEND="..."
       LOCK_MANAGER_BACKEND_ARGUMENTS="..."

   with:

   .. code-block:: ini

       LOCK_MANAGER_BACKEND="mayan.apps.lock_manager.backends.redis_lock.RedisLock"
       LOCK_MANAGER_BACKEND_ARGUMENTS="{'redis_url':'redis://:|DEFAULT_REDIS_PASSWORD|@172.17.0.1:6379/2'}"


#. Update the supervisord configuration file. Replace the environment
   variables values shown here with your respective settings. This step will refresh
   the supervisord configuration file with the new queues and the latest
   recommended layout:

   .. code-block:: bash

       sudo -u |DEFAULT_OS_USERNAME| MAYAN_MEDIA_ROOT=|MAYAN_MEDIA_ROOT| \
       |MAYAN_BIN| platformtemplate supervisord | sudo sh -c "cat > |MAYAN_SUPERVISOR_CONF|"


#. Edit the supervisord configuration file and update any setting specific to your installation:

   .. code-block:: bash

       sudo vi |MAYAN_SUPERVISOR_CONF|


#. Migrate existing database schema and static media files with:

   .. code-block:: bash

       sudo -u |DEFAULT_OS_USERNAME| MAYAN_MEDIA_ROOT=|MAYAN_MEDIA_ROOT| \
       |MAYAN_BIN| performupgrade


#. Start supervisord:

   .. code-block:: bash

       sudo systemctl start supervisor

#. Clear the browser cache to avoid loading old web assets.

The upgrade procedure is now complete.
