Mayan EDMS v0.12.1 release notes
================================

*May 2012*

This is the first maintenance release of the 0.12 series.

Overview
========

While bug fixes and minor feature were the focus for this release, some
bigger changes were included becuase of their importance.  The parsing of
document saw a complety rewrite being now class based and allows for more
than one parser per mimetype with sequencial fallback.  This provides the
best text extraction on deployments where users have control over the 
installation and basic extraction when deploying on the cloud or other
environments where users don't have the ability to install OS level
binaries.


What's new in Mayan EDMS v0.12.1
================================

Documentation update
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The installation instructions were updated to include the installation of
the libpng-dev and libjpeg-dev libraries as well as the installation of 
the poppler-utils package.  An additional step to help users test their
new installation of *Mayan EDMS* was also added.
  
Translations
~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Italian translation has been synchronized with the source files at
Transifex and finished to %100 completion.

Usability improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The index instance view now feature the same multi document action
buttons (Submit to OCR, delete, download, etc) as the mail and recent
document views.
  
Better office document conversion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A new method of converting office document has been implemented, this
new method doesn't require the use of the command line utility ``UNOCONV``.
If this new method proves to work better than previous solutions the use
of ``UNOCONV`` may be deprecated in the future.  The conversion method
adds just one new configuration option: :setting:`CONVERTER_LIBREOFFICE_PATH`
which defaults to '/usr/bin/libreoffice'.

Better PDF text parsing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Brian E submitted a patch to use the Poppler package pdftotext utility to
extract text from PDF files.  This is now the default method Mayan EDMS
will execute to try to extract text from a PDF and failing that will 
fallback to the previous method.  This change add a new configuration
option: :setting:`OCR_PDFTOTEXT_PATH` to specify the location of the ``pdftotext``
executable, it defaults to '/usr/bin/pdftotext'

Changed defaults
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
OCR_AUTOMATIC_OCR = True
OCR queue started by default
