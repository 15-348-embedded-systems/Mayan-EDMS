Mayan EDMS v0.12.1 release notes
================================

*May 2012*

This is the first maintenance release of the 0.12 series.

Overview
========

While bug fixes and minor feature were the focus for this release, some
bigger changes were included becuase of their importance.  The parsing of
document saw a complety rewrite being now class based and allows for more
than one parser per mimetype with sequencial fallback.  This provides the
best text extraction on deployments where users have control over the 
installation and basic extraction when deploying on the cloud or other
environments where users don't have the ability to install OS level
binaries.
