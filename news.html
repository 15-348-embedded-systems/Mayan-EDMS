				<h4>GPL violations, update</h4>
				<p>To all the people telling me to f****** learn to read and to RTFM the <strong>GPL</strong>: I have read the <strong>GPL</strong>, this is not my first project being released as <strong>Free software</strong>, as <strong>Open Source software</strong> or under the <strong>GPL</strong> (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/descartes-bi/">Descartes BI</a>, <a href="https://github.com/rosarior/django-replication">Django-replication</a>, <a href="https://github.com/rosarior/pdf-form-fill">pdf-form-fill</a>).  It is also not the first project to enjoy wide spread use and to be released as a commercial product by other people (<a href="https://github.com/rosarior/django-inventory">Django-inventory</a>), however in those instances the people doing the forks have complied with the <strong>GPL</strong> admirably providing source code for their changes, retaining all copyrights, notices and original license even when being released under a different name.  That however is not the situation that is happening now.  This is not "whinnying over some little program" (as it is being described commonly in the feedback I'm getting via email), the <strong>GPL</strong> is no less legal than a commercial license and must be followed and enforced equally, <strong>Mayan EDMS</strong> is not some "little program" currently sporting 26,000 lines of code.  And just because a program is being released as <strong>Free Open Source</strong> software doesn't make it any less valuable as a commercial counterpart.  Finally the entire source was not removed, only the development branch and the hotfix branch for the next version.  Let me repeat that again, the entire source code was <strong>NOT</strong> removed only the <strong>TWO (2)</strong> latest <strong>unreleased</strong> branches.  Lastly about the commercial competition issue: If I have no problems with people or business making money off <strong>Mayan EDMS</strong>, in fact I proud myself in creating commercial opportunities to others by advertising them, right here, in this very website, on the top menu, three tabs to the right.  I hope this clarifies and overturns some of the misinformation being circulated, thank you.<p/>

				<a href="#20120827"><h3><span class="red">August 27, 2012</span></h3></a>
				<h4>GPL violations</h4>
				<p>I choose to release <strong>Mayan EDMS</strong> under the <strong>GPL</strong> which means you get the source code of the software plus the freedom to use it, modify it and pass it on forward to other people.  I share the fruits of my labor and all that you are asked to do is share what you build on top of <strong>Mayan EDMS</strong> too.  If being given the software with all these liberties and that simple requirement wasn't enough, <strong>Mayan EDMS</strong> is also provided free of charge, it cost you $0.00 to download, install or use, there is no registration required, there are no limitation of the amount of user, roles, group, folders, documents, indexes or features, unlike most other open source document management software in the market.  However that doesn't mean <strong>Mayan EDMS</strong> is public domain and that it belongs to everybody, that's the only thing I'm keeping for myself, it is my property but I'm choosing to share it with you.  If you fork <strong>Mayan EDMS</strong> into a closed or private respository, stop and think about what you are doing because you going about it the wrong way.  Likewise if you fork <strong>Mayan EDMS</strong> and the first patch you commit is to change the name, stop.  It has come to my attention that there are a number of unauthorized forks of <strong>Mayan EDMS</strong> being offered for download as if the original version was being abandoned and at least one fork is being sold with a comercial license to add insult to injury.  These violators have been listed in a new page called <a href="gpl.html">GPL violations</a>.</p>
				<p>How will this affect the future of <strong>Mayan EDMS</strong>?  It is too early to tell, what is certain is that the latest technologies being added to <strong>Mayan EDMS</strong> must be protected until they are ready to be released.  Taking this into account and effective inmediately the development branch has been removed from the public repository until I figure out what to do or that it is finished and ready for public release as the next version of <strong>Mayan EDMS</strong>.</p>

				<h4>Mayan development work in progress</h4>
				<p>This has been a very exciting development cycle, many new additions are making their way into the code as well as third party project support.</p>
				<p>A huge thanks go to <a href="http://www.rtm-it.com/">RTM-IT corp.</a> for their donation of <em><strong>Citadel</strong></em>, their commercial clustering product for <strong>Mayan EDMS</strong>.  <em><strong>Citadel</strong></em> is now part of the <strong>Free Open Source</strong> version of <strong>Mayan EDMS</strong> and available for everyone to use and enjoy!  We hope that along with <a href="http://www.rtm-it.com/">RTM-IT Corp.</a> and <a href="http://www.seeopen.it/">SeeOpen S.r.l.</a> other commercial organizations step up and contribute to the core of what <strong>Mayan EDMS</strong> is.  If you make money somehow from <strong>Mayan EDMS</strong> please consider giving something back to the community, whether it is monetary donations, patches, testing and now that clustering is an integral part of <strong>Mayan EDMS</strong>, hardware for a server farm for testing will be needed, so every bit helps.</p>
				<p>Another great news is that the first mobile app specifically designed for <strong>Mayan EDMS</strong> is in the works by <strong>Pablo Juan Rivera (orangethirty)</strong>.</p>
				
					<p><img class="screenshot center" src="images/news/mayan_android_promo.png" /></p>
				
				<p>Along with a major refactoring of every internal code from navigation to tool registration some frequently requested additions have been implemented and added like: a complete move to <strong>Django 1.4</strong>, a bootstrap app to create metadata, indexes and document types to help user get up and running faster when installing <strong>Mayan EDMS</strong> for the first time.  Several more translations have made their way:  <strong>Dutch</strong> (<strong>Lucas Weel</strong>), <strong>Bulgarian</strong> (<strong>Iliya Georgiev</strong> and <strong>Koldo</strong>) and <strong>French</strong> (<strong>Pierre Lhoste</strong>).  Full migration to <strong>South</strong>, this will make upgrade from this next version onwards much easier.  Trash can support, a <strong>Pygments</strong> renderer to support colorized display of code files, initial implementation of retention policies and many more fixes and small updates everywhere.</p>

				<h4>Mayan 0.12.2 released</h4>
				<p>This is the second maintenance release of the 0.12 series.  Issues covered in this version: more secure auto admin creation, new logo in place, installation environment report app for remote debugging, anonymous statistics gathering, German translation by Tetja Rediske and Tilmann Sittig and a fix for the duplicated extension bug when uploading a new document version.  One new feature of importance is the ability to check out documents effectively blocking new versions of the document while the original user that checked out the document updates it. For more information read the full <a href="http://mayan.readthedocs.org/en/latest/releases/0.12.1.html">release notes</a>.</p>

				<h4>Mayan 0.12.1 released</h4>
				<p>Mostly a bug fix release, but three very important improvements made into this version.  The document text parsing subsystem has been re-factored to allow several parsers per file type, a new PDF parser based on poppler-utils's pdftotext utility submited by Brian E. was also added.  This is now the default method Mayan EDMS will execute to try to extract text from a PDF file and failing that will fallback to the previous method.  Be sure to install the poppler-utils OS package to take advantage of this new parser.  Also added is an improved office document conversion method that doesn't rely on unoconv to work, aside from this mayor improvements other changes made it into this release:  complete Italian translation, an automated install method using a Fabric file (fabfile) that supports single, multiple and heterogeneous deployments, the installation documentation was also updated.  The OCR queue is now active by default when first created during the syncdb phase and the OCR_AUTOMATIC_OCR option now defaults to True. These two changes are made to reduce the steps required for new users to start enjoying the benefits of automatic text extraction from uploaded documents without having to read the documentation and have a more functional default install.  As always full documentation as well a release notes can be found at <a href="http://mayan.readthedocs.org/en/latest/releases/0.12.1.html">readthedocs.com</a></p>
